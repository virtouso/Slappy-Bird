# Slappy-Bird

Its a practice project to test unity ECS system in C++ in a minimal way. <br/>
Used SDL and Box2d for making a simple clone of flappy bird game. <br/>
There is not much sophistication in the project and graphics are ugly as i'm not an artist.<br/>
Please set cofiguration to x86 and release to run the project properly.<br/>
